                As Kitchin said in her article "Cities in the New Millennium: A View from Science Fiction”,1999

                    In Cyberpunk... there is usually a "system" that dominates the lives of most “ordinary” people, be it an oppressive government, a group of large, paternalistic corporations, or a fundamentalist religion. These systems are enhanced by… “information technology" (computers, the mass media), making the system better at keeping those inside it.

                        However, as in any cultural system, there are always those who live on its margins, on "the Edge": criminals, outcasts, visionaries, or those who simply want freedom for its own sake. Cyberpunk literature focuses on these people and how they turn the system's technological tools to their own ends. This is the "punk" aspect of Cyberpunk.

                        I have always seen cyberpunk cities in science fiction and films about cyberpunk cities. And I think it is a great way to have a vision of cyberpunk to see the reality and social structure in the future.
